# many-cves

This is a simple container image that contains many CVEs. It is intended to be used for testing container scanners. It's not intended to be used for anything else.

It's based on Python 2.7, which has been deprecated for a while now, so it's filled with CVEs. This is nothing against Python, just that it's a convenient base image for this purpose.
